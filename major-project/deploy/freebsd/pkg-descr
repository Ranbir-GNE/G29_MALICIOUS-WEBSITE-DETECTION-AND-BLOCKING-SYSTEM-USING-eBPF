The Netify Agent is a deep-packet inspection server.  The Agent is built on top
of nDPI (formerly OpenDPI).

Protocol and application detections can be saved locally, served over a UNIX or
TCP socket, and/or "pushed" (via HTTP POSTs) to a remote third-party server.
Flow metadata, network statistics, and detection classifications are stored
using JSON encoding.

Optionally, the Netify Agent can be coupled with a Netify Cloud subscription for
further cloud processing, historical storage, machine-learning analysis, event
notifications, device detection/identification, along with the option (on
supported platforms) to take an active role in policing/bandwidth-shaping
specific network protocols and applications.
